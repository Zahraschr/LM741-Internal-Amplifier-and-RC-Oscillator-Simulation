# LM741-Internal-Amplifier-and-RC-Oscillator-Simulation
This project analyzes and simulates the internal structure of the LM741 operational amplifier, including its differential amplifier stage, active load, and output power stage. Additionally, an RC relaxation oscillator and integrator circuit are designed and simulated to study waveform generation and analog signal behavior.
